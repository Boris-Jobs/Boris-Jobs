# $\text{Introduction to me, Boris}$
👋 $\text{Hi, my name is Chen Zhe, but you can call me Boris.}$
$\text{I earned my bachelor's degree in Applied Physics from the University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2022.}$
$\text{Currently, I'm enrolled in the master's program in Innovative Design and Technology (with a focus on computer science)}$
$\text{at the University of Hong Kong. And I'm expected to graduate in Dec 2025.}$

- 👀 I’m interested in 1. , 2. Pure Mathematics, 3. Programming for Engaging Tasks;

- 👨‍🚀 motto: "  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every step taken, fear no distance vast;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ceaseless deeds, fear no myriad tasks;  
"

- 🚀 **Machine Learning Projects (repository name: _exploration_ML_DL, _research_hash_algorithm)**: I'm currently learning the course "Dive Into Deep Learning (PyTorch)" led by Li Mu, and I'm syncing my related learning notes in the "_exploration_ML_DL" repository. The notes are stored in the form of comments within the code. Since I'm eager to understand the knowledge thoroughly, I haven't organized the notes into a Jupyter notebook format yet. This repository will be continuously updated.

- 🚀 **Mathematics Projects (Pendulum-Period-Discussion, _exploration_algorithms)**: A question caught my interest in my high school period. Solved the problem of the period of a simple pendulum using the method of elliptic integration. "椭圆积分与单摆周期"

- 🚀 **Business_Intelligence (WanYi_DATA_Universe)**: Get the Sales and Advertisements data from OceanengineAPI then process them.


### Repositories to be created: **_notes_machine_learning**, **_notes_algorithms**.



- 💞️ My hobbies, languages like **English and French**, videos like **manim and movies**, music like **micheal and eminem**.

- 💞️ Also, I am a big fan of mao and elon musk.
