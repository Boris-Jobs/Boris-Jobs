# $\text{Introduction to me, Boris}$
ðŸ‘‹ $\text{Hi, my name is Chen Zhe, but you can call me Boris.}$
   $\text{I earned my bachelor's degree in Applied Physics from the University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2022.}$
   $\text{Currently, I'm enrolled in the master's program in Innovative Design and Technology (with a focus on computer science)}$
   $\text{at the University of Hong Kong. And I'm expected to graduate in Dec 2025.}$

- ðŸ‘€ $\text{Iâ€™m interested in 1. Artificial Intelligence, 2. Pure Mathematics and Physics, 3. Programming for Engaging Tasks;}$

- ðŸš€ **Machine Learning Projects (repository name: _exploration_ML_DL, _research_hash_algorithm)**: I'm currently learning the course "Dive Into Deep Learning (PyTorch)" led by Li Mu, and I'm syncing my related learning notes in the "_exploration_ML_DL" repository. The notes are stored in the form of comments within the code. Since I'm eager to understand the knowledge thoroughly, I haven't organized the notes into a Jupyter notebook format yet. This repository will be continuously updated.

- ðŸš€ **Mathematics Projects (repository name: Pendulum-Period-Discussion, _exploration_algorithms)**: The former was a question that I had wanted to study since high school, and it was only after graduation from university that I found time to complete the research on this topic of Pendulum Period. The latter is a note on algorithm learning that I am yet to update.

- ðŸš€ **Business Intelligence Projects (repository name: WanYi_DATA_Universe)**: This is a case of an e-commerce advertising generation platform and a program for automatically generating daily report data for data analysis that I did before.

- ðŸ“« These two are my e-mails: 1322553126@qq.com or cz1322553126@gmail.com

âœ¨ something special âœ¨ I strongly endorse the mission of xAI led by Elon Musk - Understand the Universe. Moreover, I am a die-hard fan of xAI, and that's why I want to delve deeper and further into AI.
