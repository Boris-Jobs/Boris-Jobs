# Hi there, this is Boris (Chen).
ðŸ‘‹ Applied Physics, USTB, 2018.09-2022.06; Innovative Design and Technology, HKU, 2024.09-2025.12


- ðŸ‘€ $\text{Iâ€™m interested in 1. Algebra, 2. Multimodal LLMs, 3. Multimodal Representation Learning.}$

- ðŸš€ **Machine Learning Projects (repository name: _exploration_ML_DL, _research_hash_algorithm)**: I'm currently learning the course "Dive Into Deep Learning (PyTorch)" led by Li Mu, and I'm syncing my related learning notes in the "_exploration_ML_DL" repository. The notes are stored in the form of comments within the code. Since I'm eager to understand the knowledge thoroughly, I haven't organized the notes into a Jupyter notebook format yet. This repository will be continuously updated.

- ðŸš€ **Mathematics Projects (repository name: Pendulum-Period-Discussion, _exploration_algorithms)**: The former was a question that I had wanted to study since high school, and it was only after graduation from university that I found time to complete the research on this topic of Pendulum Period. The latter is a note on algorithm learning that I am yet to update.

- ðŸš€ **Business Intelligence Projects (repository name: WanYi_DATA_Universe)**: This is a case of an e-commerce advertising generation platform and a program for automatically generating daily report data for data analysis that I did before.

âœ¨ something special âœ¨ I strongly endorse the mission of xAI led by Elon Musk - Understand the Universe. Moreover, I am a die-hard fan of xAI, and that's why I want to delve deeper and further into AI.
